displayName: FireGen – turns RTDB into your universal Generative AI API
description: >
  Listens for job requests in Realtime Database and generates videos, images, audio, or text using
  Vertex AI models (Veo, Imagen, Gemini, Chirp, Lyria). Supports AI-assisted mode (natural language)
  and explicit mode (structured parameters). Results written back to Realtime Database with signed URLs.

# What users must enable in their project.
apis:
  - apiName: aiplatform.googleapis.com
    reason: Access Vertex AI models for video, image, audio, and text generation.
  - apiName: cloudfunctions.googleapis.com
    reason: Run the FireGen worker functions.
  - apiName: eventarc.googleapis.com
    reason: Wire Cloud Functions v2 triggers (RTDB onCreate, Task Queue).
  - apiName: cloudtasks.googleapis.com
    reason: Poll async operations for video generation (Veo long-running operations).

roles:
  - role: firebasedatabase.admin
    reason:
      Allows the extension to read job requests and write results to your Realtime Database instance.
  - role: aiplatform.user
    reason: >
      Required for Vertex AI model inference via REST API (aiplatform.endpoints.predict permission).
      Used for video generation (Veo), image generation (Gemini Image), audio generation (Gemini TTS),
      and AI-assisted mode analysis (Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite). Without this role, all model calls will
      fail with 403 Forbidden errors.
  - role: storage.objectAdmin
    reason:
      Allows the extension to manage generated media files in Cloud Storage.
  - role: cloudtasks.enqueuer
    reason:
      Allows the extension to enqueue tasks for polling async video generation operations.
  - role: iam.serviceAccountUser
    reason:
      Allows the extension service account to act as itself when creating Cloud Tasks and other resources.
  - role: iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator
    reason:
      Allows the extension to generate signed URLs for Cloud Storage files, enabling temporary authenticated access to generated media.

    description: >
      Listens for new job requests in your specified Realtime Database path.
      Handles both AI-assisted mode (natural language strings) and explicit mode (structured objects).
      Routes jobs to appropriate model adapters and manages async operations for video generation.

  - name: onJobPoll
    type: firebaseextensions.v1beta.function
    description: >
      Task Queue trigger for polling async video generation operations.
      Checks Vertex AI operation status, handles retries, and updates job status in Realtime Database.
    properties:
      runtime: nodejs20
      taskQueueTrigger: {}

# No configurable parameters - extension uses hard-coded values:
# - Database instance: ${DATABASE_INSTANCE} (default Firebase RTDB instance)
# - Job path: firegen-jobs/{jobId} (hard-coded in source code)
# - All other settings are auto-resolved by the source code
